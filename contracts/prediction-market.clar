;; Title: Bitcoin Oracle Prediction Market
;; Summary: A decentralized prediction market for Bitcoin price movements
;; Description: This contract enables users to stake STX on Bitcoin price direction predictions,
;;             with winnings distributed proportionally to correct predictors. Features include
;;             customizable market parameters, oracle price resolution, and automatic reward distribution.
